# Slimeogotchi

Slimeogotchi is a virtual pet game built with Python's `tkinter` for the GUI and `pygame` for sound effects. In this game, you can interact with your pet by feeding, playing, cleaning, and showing love to keep it healthy and happy.

## Features
- **Health, Happiness, and Hygiene**: Take care of your Slimeogotchi by keeping these stats up.
- **Fun Interactions**: Feed, play, send love, clean, and give medicine to your pet.
- **Animations**: The pet has idle, eating, sleeping, and ghost animations, providing a cute and lively experience.
- **Sounds**: Each action triggers a unique sound to make the game more immersive.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- `tkinter` (should be included with Python by default)
- `Pillow` for image handling (`pip install Pillow`)
- `pygame` for sound effects (`pip install pygame`)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:    git clone https://github.com/PFKimmerle/Substack.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: cd slimeogotchi

3. **Install the required Python packages**: pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run the game**: python slimeogotchi.py

### How to Play
- **Feed** your pet to increase health
- **Sleep** to restore health and happiness
- **Play** to increase happiness but slightly reduce health
- **Clean** your pet to boost hygiene
- **Give Medicine** if your pet gets sick to restore health
- **Send Love** to increase happiness

Make sure to interact with your Slimeogotchi regularly to prevent it from getting sad or unhealthy. If you neglect it for too long, it will die and turn into a ghost. ðŸ˜¢ But don't worry, you can always reset the game and start again.
