# Slimeogotchi

Slimeogotchi is a virtual pet game built as a web-based project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this game, you can interact with your slime by feeding, playing, and letting it sleep to keep it healthy and happy. But watch outâ€”if you neglect it, your slime might get mad or even die, turning into a ghost!

## Features

- **Health and Happiness**: Take care of your Slimeogotchi by keeping these stats up.
- **Fun Interactions**: Feed, play, and put your pet to sleep to ensure it stays happy and healthy.
- **Animations**: The slime has idle, eating, sleeping, mad, and ghost animations, providing a cute and engaging experience.
- **Sounds**: Each action triggers a unique sound to make the game more immersive.
- **Pop-up Death Modal**: If your slime dies, a pop-up with a ghost and a reset button appears, allowing you to restart the game.
