# Real-Time Chat App

This repository accompanies the Simple Chat App project, a simulated real-time chat application designed for educational purposes. The app demonstrates how multiple users can engage in instant messaging using React and Socket.io, with Socket.io handling both client-side and server-side communication.

## Features

- **React**: Handles the frontend user interface and user interactions.
- **Socket.io**: Facilitates real-time communication between clients and the server.
- **Express.js**: Manages the server-side logic.
