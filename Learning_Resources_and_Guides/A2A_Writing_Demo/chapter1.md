1. Chapter 1 – The Fall of the Guild

---

The storm-laminated streets of New Cascadia glimmered beneath a bruised violet dusk, rain slicking the chrome storefronts and reflecting the city's nervous energy. The guild Vanguard huddled at the base of a yawning S-rank gate, a black gash in reality that pulsed with ominous power. Neon rain hissed against truck-mounted floodlights, their beams cutting through the gloom, while holographic hazard signs flickered their silent warnings, painting the wet streets in ghostly blue.

The gate itself—an obsidian tear in space—throbbed like a monstrous heartbeat, each pulse exhaling a wave of air that tasted of copper and cold iron, a primal scent that raised the hairs on the back of Amara's neck. A shiver ran through her despite the insulated guild jacket. Vanguard had once been the pride of Helios Dynamics, the biotech titan that bank-rolled hunters the way other corporations sponsored race-cars, their logo splashed across the city's skyline. Tonight, however, the corporate banners drooped like broken wings above the staging area, half-lit by the emergency lamps, their fabric frayed and torn as if mirroring the guild's own ragged state.

Amara Valis tugged the hem of her over-large guild jacket, the worn fabric bunching in her fist as she tried to suppress a shiver that had nothing to do with the cold. Twenty-six years old, barely five foot five, skin the color of dark honey, and wild curls escaping the confines of a battered combat hood—she looked more like a courier dodging raindrops than a hunter about to face down the horrors within an S-rank gate. Other hunters gave her sidelong glances, their expressions a mix of pity and thinly veiled contempt. Her badge glowed E-rank in faint red on her chest, a public shaming that branded her as guild dead-weight, useful only for errand runs and scavenging mana crystals after the real hunters risked their lives. She clenched her jaw, remembering the sting of Kael's words last week: "Amara, sweetie, stick to the supply runs, alright? Leave the monster-mashing to the big leagues."

Yet the gate’s call, that raw pulse of energy, tightened something in Amara’s chest, a flicker of defiance amidst the fear. It was a siren song, promising danger and the chance to prove them all wrong. Just survive the raid, she told herself, the mantra a fragile shield against the dread. Show them you’re not just a mascot.

“Stay tight, people!” Guildmaster Kael Ward barked, his voice amplified by the rain. Tall, blond, and radiating the arrogant confidence of an A-rank hunter, he flexed beneath graphite armor that smelled faintly of ozone and old victories. His gaze swept over the assembled team, lingering for a moment on Amara, a flicker of something unreadable in his blue eyes. “No solo heroics. We finish quick and head for beers. Last one standing buys the first round.” A ripple of nervous laughter spread through the group.

The assault team of twenty fanned into formation, boots crunching on the shardglass and discarded energy cells that littered the ground around the gate. With a final, shared breath, they crossed the event horizon, stepping from the familiar reality of New Cascadia into the alien depths of the Abyssal Citadel. The city vanished behind them like a snuffed hologram, leaving them swallowed by an oppressive darkness.

Inside, Abyssal Citadel waited: a cathedral of black marble veined with living shadow, its architecture defying logic and gravity. The air tasted of burning cloves and frost, an unnatural combination that bit at the lungs; every breath painted ghosts that refused to fade, swirling around them like malevolent spirits. An unsettling silence hung in the air, broken only by the drip of unseen water and the distant moan of wind that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once.

Then, the shadows stirred. Wraiths congealed from the very pillars, their forms coalescing from the darkness, eyes glowing ruby-bright with malevolent hunger, their voices a discordant choir of static that scraped against the mind. Veterans surged forward, years of experience kicking in: Lira’s arrows whistled trails of phosphor, illuminating the gloom with streaks of vibrant light, Kael’s force-blade sang as it sliced through the air, leaving trails of shimmering energy in its wake, and heavies lobbed concussion grenades that folded light and cracked stone with devastating force.

Amara tracked Kael’s flank, her iron shortsword feeling light and inadequate in her sweaty gloves. Fear gnawed at her, but she pushed it down, focusing on the dance of battle. The first wraith she met moved with impossible speed, its claws a blur of darkness that sliced through her parry as if the metal were mist. Cold raked her ribs, a searing pain that stole her breath; she slammed into a nearby pillar, vision spattering with pale sparks as the world tilted sideways.

Pain tasted of pennies and ozone, sharp and metallic in her mouth. The wraith arched above her for a kill-swipe, its shadow falling over her like a shroud—

—and time fractured. The world around her seemed to stutter and freeze. A translucent window blazed into existence above her, shimmering like stained glass made of lines of code, an impossible intrusion into reality:

─────────────────────────────────────────

SYSTEM INITIALIZING…

You have awakened the Unique Protocol:

ASCENDANT PATH

Vital scan complete – fatal outcome imminent.

Do you accept contract?

\[ ACCEPT ] \[ DECLINE ]

─────────────────────────────────────────

The wraith’s claw hovered inches from her face, frozen mid-air, a grotesque tableau waiting for her choice. The air crackled with unseen energy, the silence amplifying the frantic drumming of Amara’s pulse in her ears, louder than any cannon-fire. Her mind raced, a whirlwind of confusion and disbelief, but beneath it all, a primal instinct screamed Survive. With a trembling grin that was half defiance, half hysteria, she jabbed a blood-slick thumb at ACCEPT.

The world restarted, the flow of time resuming as if a pause button had been released—only this time, Amara was no longer the weakest piece on the board. Something had shifted, something fundamental, and she could feel it thrumming beneath her skin.
