1. Chapter 2 – Awakening

---

She stood in a weightless void, a silent expanse littered with constellations of cascading code, lines of light stretching into infinity. It was a place of pure information, where reality seemed to unravel into its digital skeleton. There was no sound, no sensation of touch or smell, yet every line of data pulsed with meaning, ringing in her mind like distant bells, a symphony of the universe's inner workings. A sense of awe, mixed with a healthy dose of terror, washed over her.

Then, a familiar interface materialized before her, stark white against the endless black:

─────────────────────────────────────────

A new prompt unfolded, the words burning themselves into her consciousness:

Quest: SURVIVE THE ABYSSAL CITADEL

Reward: Experience + Random Skill

Penalty: Death

Cold fear, sharp and immediate, pierced through the wonder. Death? The word echoed in the silent void, a stark reminder of her precarious situation. But another, hotter pulse followed, a surge of adrenaline and something akin to exhilaration: Option. Power. This System, this impossible gift, offered her a chance to change her fate. She hit ACCEPT again, the decision feeling both terrifying and liberating.

The void shattered like glass dropped on stone, the sensation of falling yanking her back into the brutal reality of the Citadel.

Back in the oppressive darkness, the wraith’s slash descended—but this time, Amara was ready. The world seemed to slow around her, the wraith's movements telegraphing themselves in glowing lines of attack blooming as bright vectors in her sight, a path laid out before her. It was like seeing the code of reality itself. She pivoted on her heel, the worn leather of her boots skidding on the slick stone, and cut upward with a speed she didn't know she possessed. Steel hissed through the air, meeting insubstantial flesh; the wraith dissolved into phosphorescent ash that erupted in a silent explosion of light, the particles soaking into her skin like warm rain, leaving behind a tingling sensation of energy.

LEVEL UP → 2

Allocate 3 stat points.

The words appeared in her vision, stark and undeniable. With a surge of giddy disbelief, she thought, This is real, and mentally allocated her points. Two into STR, feeling a satisfying clench of newfound power in her muscles, the other into AGI, her reflexes sharpening, the world seeming to come into sharper focus.

A trio of skills flickered into existence, each a tantalizing possibility:

Quickstep
Sword Mastery
Shadow Bind

She took Sword Mastery, the words resonating deep within her. It was less a choice and more an instinct.

Memories not her own flooded her muscle memory, a lifetime of training compressed into a single instant; her next swing flowed like water over stone, each movement precise and economical, carving clean arcs through two more specters that had crept up behind her. The sword felt like an extension of her arm, the weight familiar and comforting.

Across the chamber, Kael was down on one knee, his usually pristine gauntlet crushed, dark blood painting the gleaming chrome. His face was pale, strained with pain. Hunters lay silent under black veils of draining mist, their life force being leached away by the Citadel's insidious power. Only five remained standing, their breaths coming in ragged gasps. Lira was supporting him, her face a mask of concentration as she wove a glowing bandage of mana around his ruined hand. Even injured, the A-rank hunter's presence radiated authority, a stark contrast to the fear in the eyes of the others.

“Amara?” Kael blinked in disbelief, his gaze sweeping over her, lingering on the faint glow that still clung to her sword. He looked like a man seeing a ghost.

“I’ll clear a path,” she answered, her voice a steadier register than she felt, the System's power lending her a newfound confidence. She gripped her sword tighter, the iron reassuringly solid in her hand.

Together—rookie and captain, the unlikely duo—they fought corridor by corridor, senses alive to every chilling gust of wind and the tang of ozone that heralded another attack. Amara moved with a fluid grace that surprised even herself, the System guiding her movements, enhancing her strength and speed. Each kill nourished the System, feeding its power; each surge of energy stitched new certainty into Amara’s bones, replacing fear with a growing sense of purpose.

Hours—or minutes, time became meaningless in the Citadel's oppressive embrace—later, they breached the inner sanctum. The chamber was vast and impossibly high, columns clawing upward into a darkness beyond the reach of their torches, their tops lost in shadow. In the center, atop an altar of ribs that pulsed with a faint, malevolent light, the boss crouched: a towering lupine shade crowned with horns of molten glass that dripped with an unholy heat. Its breath rolled out in waves, a heat that felt like opening the door of a forge, and its eyes burned with ancient malice.

WARNING: S-CLASS ENTITY DETECTED

Tactical suggestion: joint assault.

The System's voice echoed in her mind, a cold, logical assessment of the impossible odds. Amara licked her cracked lips, the taste of blood and dust a grim reminder of the battle's cost. She glanced at Kael, his face grim but resolute, and at Lira, who nodded, her eyes glowing with determination despite her injury. So be it.
