# How Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Collaborates to Write a Story

This repository contains a short story titled **_The Fall of the Guild_**, created using a multi-agent AI workflow known as Agent-to-Agent (A2A). The project explores how AI agents can support and enhance the fiction writing process through structured collaboration.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how multiple AI agents can assist in co-authoring narrative fiction. Each agent was assigned a specific role in the writing workflow, such as drafting, editing, or maintaining narrative consistency. The story was developed iteratively, with the human author providing guidance, review, and final edits.

## Contents

- `chapter1.md` — _The Fall of the Guild_  
- `chapter2.md` — _Awakening_  
- `chapter3.md` — _Call to Arms_  

Each file is written in Markdown for easy readability and formatting on GitHub.

## A2A Agent Roles

- **Narrative Agent**: Responsible for generating prose, descriptions, and dialogue.
- **Editor Agent**: Focused on grammar, pacing, and clarity.  
- **System Agent**: Maintained consistency in terminology, lore, and rules across chapters.

These agents collaborated through a structured feedback loop using tools such as AutoGenStudio, with the human author reviewing and approving each iteration.

## Process Notes

The writing process combined automated generation with human editorial oversight. AI agents handled drafting and revision tasks, while all structural decisions, tone, and final narrative choices were made by the author. This hybrid workflow aimed to balance AI-assisted speed with human storytelling control.
