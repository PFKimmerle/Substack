# Python Class Scheduler

This project demonstrates a simple class scheduling system using Python. It randomly assigns classes to students across different periods, showcasing how coding can simplify complex organizational tasks.

## Features

- Randomly assigns 7 classes to each student
- Distributes classes across 7 periods
- Allows users to view individual student schedules or all schedules

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/PFKimmerle/Substack.git

2. Navigate to the project directory: cd python-class-scheduler
`

### Usage

Run the script: python class_scheduler.py

Follow the prompts to view individual student schedules or all schedules.

## How It Works

The script uses Python's `random` module to assign classes to students. Here's a brief overview of the process:

1. Define lists of students and available classes
2. Create a function to assign classes to students randomly
3. Generate a schedule for all students
4. Display the schedule and allow user interaction
